# Masked Image Modeling: A Survey
We surveyed recent studies on masked image modeling (MIM), an approach that emerged as a powerful self-supervised learning technique in computer vision. The MIM task involves masking some information, e.g. pixels, patches, or even latent representations, and training a model, usually an autoencoder, to predicting the missing information by using the context available in the visible part of the input. This repository categorizes the papers about masked image modeling, according to their contribution. The classifcation is based on our survey [Masked Image Modeling: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06687).
